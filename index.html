    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a  high school student inrested by a strong desire to grow, explore, and gain hands-on experience across diverse fields. 
        While my primary passion lies in computer science, I am always eager to expand my horizons and take on new challenges. 
        I pride myself on being a quick learner who thrives in collaborative environments and adapts easily to new skills and responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of academics and work, I occasionally do photography, and as a hobby, I enjoy creating videos. 
        These interests fuel my creativity and deepen my appreciation for digital media and storytelling.
